**Project Overview**

The Python Telebot Programs repository demonstrates how Python can be used to build interactive Telegram bots. 
The bots range from simple automated replies to more advanced features like fetching external data, handling commands, and managing user input.
These programs can serve as templates or examples for developers interested in building their own Telegram bots using the Telebot API.

**Why Telebot?**

The Telebot API is a Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API, allowing developers to easily create bots that can interact with Telegram users. With Telebot, you can:

- Create and manage Telegram bots quickly.

- Handle user messages, commands, and inline queries.

- Integrate external APIs and services into your bots etc.

Configuration

Get Your Telegram Bot Token

Before running any bot, you need to create a bot on Telegram and obtain the API token:

1. Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.


2. Use the /start command to interact with BotFather.


3. Create a new bot by using the /newbot command and follow the instructions.


4. Once created, you will receive an API token. Copy this token as it will be needed in your bot's code.



**Setting Up the Bot Token**

In each Python bot script, replace the placeholder token with your actual bot token:

import telebot

 **Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual bot token from BotFather**
bot = telebot.TeleBot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")


---

**How to Use**

1. After configuring the bot token, run any bot script with the following command:

python bot_name.py


2. The bot will start running, and you will be able to interact with it on Telegram by sending messages, commands, or using inline queries.



**Bot Commands**

Each bot supports specific commands that users can issue directly in Telegram. Below is an example of some typical commands:

/start: Starts the bot and provides an introduction or menu of options.

/help: Displays help information and a list of supported commands.

/info: Provides information or details based on the bot's functionality.
